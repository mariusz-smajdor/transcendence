description: Guidelines for ft_transcendence backend in JavaScript with Node.js Fastify

-- Framework --
- Use Node.js with Fastify.
- Use JWT for authentication.
- Use bcrypt for secure password hashing.
- Use SQLite for database persistence.

-- Folder Structure --
- Source code is inside the src/ folder.
- Use folders: src/models/, src/routes/, src/controllers/, src/services/, src/utils/.
- Models contain DB schemas and queries.
- Routes declare Fastify endpoints.
- Controllers handle HTTP logic.
- Services implement business logic and DB access.
- Utils have helper functions.

-- Coding Best Practices --
- Write modular, clean, and DRY code.
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

-- Testing --
- Encourage writing unit tests for controllers and services.
